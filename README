Our AI engine turns citizen reports into actionable missions, making communities **smarter, cleaner, and more connected**.

## 🛠 Core Functionality & Workflow

1. **Report** → Citizens submit civic issues (photo + location).
2. **Triage (AI)** → Our AI engine categorizes the issue, checks severity, and detects duplicates.
3. **Resolve** → Volunteers or sponsored teams accept missions to fix the problem.
4. **Reward** → Completed missions are verified, and impact is showcased on a public dashboard.
